# Contextual-Stack-Navigator
Contextual Stack Navigator (CSN), a navigation aid that helps users navigate in exploratory visual analysis(EVA). CSN stores views generated during the exploration process in a hierarchical structure and provides users with clear contextual cues. CSN is not constrained by data representation types, making it applicable to a wide range of data analysis scenarios while supporting intuitive interactions and flexible data exploration.
