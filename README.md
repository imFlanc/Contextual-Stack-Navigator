## Overview
The **Contextual Stack Navigator (CSN)** is an advanced navigation aid designed to support **exploratory visual analysis (EVA)**. By storing views generated during the exploration process in a hierarchical structure, CSN offers users clear contextual cues, enhancing the navigation experience. Its flexibility allows CSN to be used across various data analysis scenarios, making it applicable to diverse fields without being constrained by specific data representations.

## Key Features
- **Spatial Context Awareness**: Offers users intuitive visual context throughout the exploration process.
- **Hierarchical View Management**: Organizes views in a stack-like structure to help users backtrack and refine their analysis.
- **Flexible and Intuitive Interaction**: Facilitates smooth and efficient data exploration without requiring domain-specific representations.
